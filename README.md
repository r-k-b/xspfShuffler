# xspfShuffler
Designed to read three folders of video files, and output one playlist consisting of 
the 3 input folders joined in a certain order.

Mostly for the purpose of creating a 'TV-like' experience from a 
collection of long, medium, and short videos. (i.e., 'Programmes', 
'ad breaks', and 'interstitials'). 

Designed specifically for VLC Media Player[1] and the .xspf[2] playlist file.
